# LOL_PlayerStat_App

 Project Overview:
    The League of Legends Player Stats App is a user-friendly application developed specifically for beginner League of Legends players. The primary goal of the app is to provide an easy-to-use platform that allows users to track their personal stats, compare their performance against other players, and gain insights into their gameplay related to specific objectives in the game, such as creep score (CS), gold accumulation, kills, deaths, and more.
    
    The app aims to empower beginner players to improve their gameplay and get to the next level. Pun intended ;)

    Key Features:

    Personal Stats Dashboard: The app displays essential statistics, including win rate, kill-to-death ratio, average CS per game, gold per minute, and other important metrics. This dashboard provides a quick overview of the user's performance and allows them to monitor their progress over the past 20 games.

    Comparative Analysis: Users can compare their performance against other players of similar skill level. The app provides easy-to-understand visualizations and charts that highlight the user's strengths and areas for improvement in comparison to their fellow players. This feature allows beginner players to identify where they stand and set goals for improvement.

    Objective-Based Performance Tracking: The app focuses on specific objectives within the game, such as CS, gold,dragons obtained and kills, to help players gauge their performance in these areas. By tracking progress and providing insights into their performance, players can  identify areas for growth and offer tips.

    User-Friendly Interface: The app prioritizes ease of use, catering specifically to beginner players. The interface employs intuitive navigation, clear icons, and minimalistic design elements to ensure that users can quickly access the desired information and understand their stats without confusion.
